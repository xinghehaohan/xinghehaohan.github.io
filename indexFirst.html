                                    This project uses fis3 as a build tool, react + react-router + antd + mobx + npm + mockJS architecture. I am in charge of this project management platform, large-screen control, configuration management, control centers and other business-related modules development work. In the large-screen control module, leaders are most satisfied. The bank side hopes that the large-screen control can be automated and configurable, so the steps and relationships in the configuration page are. Iframes and websockets are used for communication. 15s polls large screen page ID data, and then changes the page address. Configurable large screen pages build a modular library of internal components such as backgrounds, borders, text, charts, lists, charts, and more.

                                    This project uses webpack as a build tool, jquery+bootstrap+echarts+mockJs+npm+jenkins architecture. The development team established by the project in Urumqi Bank is also the project I started in the company. It is not mature enough in technology, so I used a more conservative front-end technology architecture: jquery+webpack+bootstrap+mockJs+npm. I), 5 backends, 1 architect, and one project manager. I am responsible for the front-end technical architecture in this project, and complete the front-end page development needs of the bank. I encountered a problem in this project: the monitoring center's event console, displaying large data volume, alarm status and alarm display conditions, alarm notification behavior, and alarm confirmation upgrade, etc. The business logic is slightly complicated. When solving, I will be complicated. The problem is constantly being refined and discussed with the back end. List all the possible states or the requirements that will be modified. After clearing the idea, use the open source component library bootstrap-table to complete the event console module. Received recognition from colleagues and leaders.

                                    The first development work after graduating took three months from the front end of self-study to the familiarity with the workflow.
                                    The patient guidance of my leadership and my lack of experience make me feel pressure.It's also urge me to speed up my learning
                                    <br>
                                      From the inability to independently complete work tasks, to independent analysis after completion of the tasks assigned by the leadership, I was gradually able to stand alone, the technology in the work is growing fast,
                                    And because of my seriousness and responsibility, leaders positively affirmed the progress of my work.
